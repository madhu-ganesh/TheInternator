## Key Features
* The application records how many hours the user has worked so far in the week.

* It will calculate bi-weekly paychecks and alert user when it is payday.

* It will have a “To-Do” list of what issues user needs to solve for the next day/next week and will have the ability to mark items that are completed on that list.

* As the user marks items he/she has completed, they will populate the “Accomplished tasks” list which can be used as a report for the weekly meeting.

## Will Build with

* Express + node
* Bootstrap + HTML/CSS + JavaScript

## Future Work
*  The app will give suggestions of when he/she could complete the remaining hours (this will be done by synching his/her Google calendar with the app to know free timings, class schedule, etc).

* The app will have the functionality of adding deadlines for items on the “To-Do” list and send appropriate reminder emails as the time to accomplish this task gets closer.

* It will send an email to his/her manager when a task is completed to keep manager in the loop.

* This can also be made into a multi-user app by having login, adding the ability to form teams on the app where people in the same team can provide feedback to each others' tasks.
